# Position of knight on a chess board.

To solve this problem I have taken a 8*8 chessboard. Each tile on the chessboard is represented by a unique number.
In this program we find out all the possible positions a knight can acquire in its next move. For this we ask the user to enter the value of the position where he wants his knight placed. And upon running the program, the user is displayed with all the coordinates where the knight can be moved in the next position.
The output also displays the board where the knight is placed (represented by K) and the tiles where the knight can be moved(represented by M).
